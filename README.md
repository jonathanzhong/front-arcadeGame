#Classic Arcade Game Clone
![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=Progress)

## Project Objective:
You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

##What I have Done:
- Utilized JavaScript's object oriented programming features to write "Enemy" and "Player" classes to create instances of objects.
- Deployed a pseudoclassical pattern.

## Game Running and Playing Instructions:

CLICK the "index.html" file, then you are ready to play with it.
